# MyEcom â€“ E-Commerce Platform

## Overview
**MyEcom** is a simple e-commerce platform built to demonstrate backend development skills using Java and Spring Boot.  
The backend is fully developed by me, while the frontend is "integrated from a pre-built template"
 for demonstration purposes.

  - Java (Core)
  - Spring Boot

  - JDBC (Partial)
  - Servlets & JSP
- Implemented REST APIs for:
  - Product management
